# Length_Converter

"Length Converter" is an desktop application, where you can convert length from Kilometer to mile, yard and foot. I got to work on the project via Fiverr, and the project is given by a client resides in USA.

/------------------------------------- Length Conver ------------------------------------------/

If you open the "Executable Jar" file you will get screen where written Kilometer.

You need enter any of the value you want except strings or characters.

Then if you choose mile or yard or foot, it will give you the answers.
